This project is a landing page with animations and a 3D model that was initially developed for a customer. However, the customer decided to cancel the project midway. As a result, the project is now open source.

While the full project was not completed, I have decided to make it available for anyone who might find it useful or would like to build upon it.

## Features

- **Landing Page**: Responsive design with smooth animations.
- **3D Model**: Interactive 3D model integrated into the page for enhanced user experience.

## Live Demo
